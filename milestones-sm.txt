2 Hours:    Updating my old code (BlackJack and Slot Machine)
1 Hour :    Setting Up Repository and Ordering Files
3 Hours:    Reading about proper website organization, setting up files,
                Writing Website

15 Working Blender Model
25 Working Website

You can see the website (VERY MUCH STILL IN PROGRESS) here:

    This challenege went well! I'm starting a job soon in web development 
that I'm honestly woefully underqualified for, so getting this time to
practice before I start is really valauble. I'm also excited to set up a 
website where we can eventually put host Arcade-Cabinet Executable.
