20 tutorial for c#
15 intro to Unity
5 set up Unity account

what I learned:
Going through the tutorials for C# I learned that it is similar to C and C++.
There is some minor differences and one thing I noticed is that the fucntions that 
are used are usually capitalized instead of lowercase. This is something I noticed about
C#. For learning the language I used two websites, one was better for reading and the other had reading and 
tutorials that you could run through. https://www.guru99.com/c-sharp-tutorial.html and https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php

Then I set up my Unity profile and this took a bit to make sure that all of the 
software and needed programs were downloaded. I also had to make sure that all
of the software is compatible with my system. 

Then I ran through the UNity learn tutorial for the system. This allowed me to see
a bit more how the software works and what kind of thing it will acheive, for this 
I used https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials. It is a simple tutorial but allowed 
me to learn a bit more of the environment and how to run and use the software when designing
for our project.

Overview:
There was no major code that went to the repository but I still managed to learn 
some essential stuff for the project ahead. This is important for the success of 
the project and developing skills. Some things took longer than originally expected
and other things took less.
